\usage{
bfactor(data, model, model2 = paste0("G = 1-", ncol(data)),
  group = NULL, quadpts = NULL, invariance = "", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} that consists of
numerically ordered data, with missing data coded as \code{NA}}

\item{model}{a numeric vector specifying which factor loads on which
item. For example, if for a 4 item test with two specific factors, the first
specific factor loads on the first two items and the second specific factor
on the last two, then the vector is \code{c(1,1,2,2)}. For items that should only load
on the second-tier factors (have no specific component) \code{NA} values may
be used as place-holders. These numbers will be translated into a format suitable for
\code{mirt.model()}, combined with the definition in \code{model2}, with the letter 'S'
added to the respective factor number}

\item{model2}{a two-tier model specification object defined by \code{mirt.model()} or
a string to be passed to \code{\link{mirt.model}}. By default
the model will fit a unidimensional model in the second-tier, and therefore be equivalent to
the bifactor model}

\item{group}{a factor variable indicating group membership used for multiple group analyses}

\item{quadpts}{number of quadrature nodes to use after accounting for the reduced number of dimensions.
Scheme is the same as the one used in \code{\link{mirt}}, however it is in regards to the reduced
dimensions (e.g., a bifactor model has 2 dimensions to be integrated)}

\item{invariance}{see \code{\link{multipleGroup}} for details, however, the specific factor variances
and means will be constrained according to the dimensional reduction algorithm}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to the estimation engine. See \code{\link{mirt}}
for more details and examples}
}
\value{
function returns an object of class \code{SingleGroupClass}
  (\link{SingleGroupClass-class}) or \code{MultipleGroupClass}(\link{MultipleGroupClass-class}).
}
\description{
\code{bfactor} fits a confirmatory maximum likelihood two-tier/bifactor/testlet model to
dichotomous and polytomous data under the item response theory paradigm.
The IRT models are fit using a dimensional reduction EM algorithm so that regardless
of the number of specific factors estimated the model only uses the number of
factors in the second-tier structure plus 1. For the bifactor model the maximum
number of dimensions is only 2 since the second-tier only consists of a
ubiquitous unidimensional factor. See \code{\link{mirt}} for appropriate methods to be used
on the objects returned from the estimation.
}
\details{
\code{bfactor} follows the item factor analysis strategy explicated by
Gibbons and Hedeker (1992), Gibbons et al. (2007), and Cai (2010).
Nested models may be compared via an approximate
chi-squared difference test or by a reduction in AIC or BIC (accessible via
\code{\link{anova}}). See \code{\link{mirt}} for more details regarding the
IRT estimation approach used in this package.

The two-tier model has a specific block diagonal covariance structure between the primary and
secondary latent traits. Namely, the secondary latent traits are assumed to be orthogonal to
all traits and have a fixed variance of 1, while the primary traits can be organized to vary
and covary with other primary traits in the model.

\deqn{\Sigma_{two-tier} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} G & 0 \\ 0 & diag(S) \end{array} \right)}

The bifactor model is a special case of the two-tier model when \eqn{G} above is a 1x1 matrix,
and therefore only 1 primary factor is being modeled. Evaluation of the numerical integrals
for the two-tier model requires only \eqn{ncol(G) + 1} dimensions for integration since the
\eqn{S} second order (or 'specific') factors require only 1 integration grid due to the
dimension reduction technique.

Note: for multiple group two-tier analyses only the second-tier means and variances
should be freed since the specific factors are not treated independently due to the
dimension reduction technique.
