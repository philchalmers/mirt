\usage{
mirt.model(input = NULL, itemnames = NULL, file = "", COV = NULL,
  quiet = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{input for writing out the model syntax. Can either be a string declaration of
class character or the so-called Q-matrix or class \code{matrix} that specifies the model
either with integer or logical values. If the Q-matrix method
is chosen covariances terms can be specified with the \code{COV} input}

\item{itemnames}{a character vector or factor indicating the item names. If a data.frame or
matrix object is supplied the names will be extracted using \code{colnames(itemnames)}.
Supplying this input allows the syntax to be specified with the raw item names rather than
item locations}

\item{file}{a input specifying an external file that declares the input.}

\item{COV}{a symmetric, logical matrix used to declare which covariance terms are estimated}

\item{quiet}{logical argument passed to \code{scan()} to suppress console read message}

\item{...}{additional arguments for \code{scan()}}
}
\value{
Returns a model specification object to be used in
  \code{\link{mirt}}, \code{\link{bfactor}}, \code{\link{multipleGroup}}, or
  \code{\link{mixedmirt}}
}
\description{
The \code{mirt.model} function scans/reads user input to specify the
confirmatory model. Item locations must be used in the specifications if no
\code{itemnames} argument is supplied. This is called implicitly by estimation functions
when a string is passed to the \code{model} argument.
}
\details{
Factors are first named and then specify which numerical items they affect
(i.e., where the slope is not equal to 0), separated either by commas or by
- to indicate a range of items. Products between factors may be specified
by enclosing the left hand term within brackets. To finish the declaration of
a model simply enter a blank line with only a carriage return (i.e., the
'enter' or 'return' key), or instead read in an input version of the model syntax.
The associated slopes throughout the package label these coefficients as
\code{a1, a2, ..., ak}, where the associated number is assigned according to the
respective order of the defined factors.

For example, if the syntax were

\code{"G = 1-10
       F = 1-5
       A = 6-10"}

then the \code{G} factor would be assigned the slopes \code{a1} for each item, \code{F} assigned
the slopes \code{a2}, and \code{A} assigned the slopes \code{a3}. The same principle applies to the
\code{\link{bfactor}} function whereby the slopes are automatically included for the specific factors
after the general factor structure has been assigned.

There is an optional keyword for specifying the correlation between relationships between factors
called \code{COV}, and non-linear factor products can be included by enclosing the product
combination on the left hand side of the declaration (e.g., \code{(F1*F1)} would create a
quadratic factor for \code{F1}).

The keywords \code{CONSTRAIN, CONSTRAINB, PRIOR, FIXED, FREE, START, UBOUND, LBOUND} can
be applied to specific sub-groups in multiple-group models by included square brackets before the
= sign, where groups are separated by commas. For example, to apply within-group equality
constraints to a group called "male", then specifying:

\code{CONSTRAIN [male] = (1-5, a1)}

is appropriate, while specifying the same constraints to the sub-groups
"male" and "female" would appear as

\code{CONSTRAIN [male, female] = (1-5, a1)}

For all other groups in the multi-group model, these within-group equality constraints would not appear. Therefore, these
bracketed group specifications are useful when modifying priors, starting values, between/within group equality constraints,
and so on when the specifications for each sub-group may differ.

Finally, the keyword \code{GROUP} can be used to specify the group-level
hyper-parameter terms, such as the means and variance of the default Gaussian
distribution. For example, to set the starting value of the variance
parameter (\code{COV_11}) to 1.5:

\code{START = (GROUP, COV_11, 1.5)}

\describe{
  \item{COV}{Specify the relationship between the latent factors.
  Estimating a correlation between factors is declared by joining the two
  factors with an asterisk (e.g., F1*F2), or with an asterisk between three or more factors
  to estimate all the possible correlations (e.g., F1*F2*F3)}

\item{MEAN}{A comma separated list specifying which latent factor means to freely estimate.
  E.g., \code{MEAN = F1, F2} will free the latent means for factors F1 and F2}

\item{CONSTRAIN}{A bracketed, comma separated list specifying equality constrains between items.
  The input format is
  \code{CONSTRAIN = (items, ..., parameterName(s)),
  (items, ..., parameterName)}.

For example, in a single group 10-item dichotomous tests, using the default 2PL model,
  the first and last 5 item slopes (a1) can be constrained to be equal by using
  \code{CONSTRAIN = (1-5, a1), (6-10, a1)}, or some combination
  such as \code{CONSTRAIN = (1-3,4,5,a1), (6,7,8-10,a1)}.

When constraining parameters to be equal across items with different parameter names, a
  balanced bracketed vector must be supplied. E.g., setting the first slope for item 1 equal to
  the second slope in item 3 would be \code{CONSTRAIN = (1, 3, a1, a2)}
  }

\item{CONSTRAINB}{A bracketed, comma separate list specifying equality constrains between groups.
  The input format is \code{CONSTRAINB = (items, ..., parameterName),
  (items, ..., parameterName)}.

For example, in a two group 10-item dichotomous tests, using the default 2PL model, the first
  5 item slopes (a1) can be constrained to be equal across both groups by using
  \code{CONSTRAINB = (1-5, a1)}, or some combination such as \code{CONSTRAINB = (1-3,4,5,a1)}}

\item{PRIOR}{A bracketed, comma separate list specifying prior parameter distributions.
  The input format is
  \code{PRIOR = (items, ..., parameterName, priorType, val1, val2),
  (items, ..., parameterName, priorType, val1, val2)}.
  For example, in a single group 10-item dichotomous tests, using the default 2PL model,
  defining a normal prior of N(0,2) for the first 5 item intercepts (d) can be defined by
  \code{PRIOR = (1-5, d, norm, 0, 2)}

Currently supported priors are of the form: \code{(items, norm, mean, sd)}
  for the normal/Gaussian, \code{(items, lnorm, log_mean, log_sd)} for log-normal,
  \code{(items, beta, alpha, beta)} for beta, and \code{(items, expbeta, alpha, beta)}
  for the beta distribution after applying the
  function \code{\link{plogis}} to the input value (note, this is specifically for applying a beta
  prior to the lower-bound parameters in 3/4PL models)}

\item{LBOUND}{A bracketed, comma separate list specifying lower bounds for estimated
  parameters (used in optimizers such as \code{L-BFGS-B} and \code{nlminb}).
  The input format is \code{LBOUND = (items, ..., parameterName, value),
  (items, ..., parameterName, value)}.

For example, in a single group 10-item dichotomous tests, using the 3PL model and
  setting lower bounds for the 'g' parameters for the first 5 items to 0.2 is accomplished with
  \code{LBOUND = (1-5, g, 0.2)}}

\item{UBOUND}{same as LBOUND, but specifying upper bounds in estimated parameters}

\item{START}{A bracketed, comma separate list specifying the starting values for individual parameters.
  The input is of the form \code{(items, ..., parameterName, value)}. For instance, setting the 10th and
  12th to 15th item slope parameters (a1) to 1.0 is specified with \code{START = (10, 12-15, a1, 1.0)}

For more hands on control of the starting values pass the argument \code{pars = 'values'} through
  whatever estimation function is being used}

\item{FIXED}{A bracketed, comma separate list specifying which parameters should be fixed at their
  starting values (i.e., not freely estimated).
  The input is of the form \code{(items, ..., parameterName)}. For instance, fixing the 10th and
  12th to 15th item slope parameters (a1) is accomplished with \code{FIXED = (10, 12-15, a1)}

For more hands on control of the estimated values pass the argument \code{pars = 'values'} through
  whatever estimation function is being used}

\item{FREE}{Equivalent to the \code{FIXED} input, except that parameters are freely estimated instead
  of fixed at their starting value}

\item{NEXPLORE}{Number of exploratory factors to extract. Usually this is not required
  because passing a numeric value to the \code{model} argument in the estimation function
  will generate an exploratory factor analysis model, however if different start values,
  priors, lower and upper bounds, etc, are desired then this input can be used}
