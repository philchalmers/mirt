\title{Compute the M2 model fit statistic}
\usage{
M2(obj, calcNull = TRUE, quadpts = NULL, theta_lim = c(-6, 6),
  impute = 0, CI = 0.9, residmat = FALSE, QMC = FALSE,
  suppress = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{an estimated model object from the mirt package}

\item{calcNull}{logical; calculate statistics for the null model as well?
Allows for statistics such as the limited information TLI and CFI. Only valid when items all
have a suitable null model (e.g., those created via \code{\link{createItem}} will not)}

\item{quadpts}{number of quadrature points to use during estimation. If \code{NULL},
a suitable value will be chosen based
on the rubric found in \code{\link{fscores}}}

\item{theta_lim}{lower and upper range to evaluate latent trait integral for each dimension}

\item{impute}{a number indicating how many imputations to perform
(passed to \code{\link{imputeMissing}}) when there are missing data present. This requires
a precomputed \code{Theta} input. Will return a data.frame object with the mean estimates
of the stats and their imputed standard deviations}

\item{CI}{numeric value from 0 to 1 indicating the range of the confidence interval for
RMSEA. Default returns the 90\% interval}

\item{residmat}{logical; return the residual matrix used to compute the SRMSR statistic?
Only the lower triangle of the residual correlation matrix will be returned
(the upper triangle is filled with NA's)}

\item{QMC}{logical; use quasi-Monte Carlo integration? Useful for higher dimensional models.
If \code{quadpts} not specified, 5000 nodes are used by default}

\item{suppress}{a numeric value indicating which parameter residual dependency combinations
to flag as being too high. Absolute values for the standardized residuals greater than
this value will be returned, while all values less than this value will be set to NA.
Must be used in conjunction with the argument \code{residmat = TRUE}}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame object with the M2 statistic, along with the degrees of freedom,
  p-value, RMSEA (with 90\% confidence interval), SRMSR for each group (if all items were ordinal),
  and optionally the TLI and CFI model fit statistics of \code{calcNull = TRUE}.
}
\description{
Computes the M2 (Maydeu-Olivares & Joe, 2006) statistic for dichotomous data and the
M2* statistic for polytomous data (collapsing over response categories for better stability;
see Cai and Hansen, 2013), as well as associated fit indices that are based on
fitting the null model. Supports single and multiple-group models.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
dat <- as.matrix(expand.table(LSAT7))
(mod1 <- mirt(dat, 1))
M2(mod1)
M2(mod1, residmat=TRUE) #lower triangle of residual correlation matrix

#M2 imputed with missing data present (run in parallel)
dat[sample(1:prod(dim(dat)), 250)] <- NA
mod2 <- mirt(dat, 1)
mirtCluster()
M2(mod2, impute = 10)
