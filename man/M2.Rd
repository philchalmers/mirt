\title{Compute the M2 model fit statistic}
\usage{
M2(obj, type = "M2*", calcNull = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE,
  quadpts = NULL, theta_lim = c(-6, 6), impute = 0, CI = 0.9,
  residmat = FALSE, QMC = FALSE, suppress = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{an estimated model object from the mirt package}

\item{type}{type of fit statistic to compute. Options are "M2", "M2*" for the univariate and
bivariate collapsed version of the M2 statistic ("M2" currently limited to dichotomous
response data only), and "C2" for a hybrid between
M2 and M2* where only the bivariate moments are collapsed}

\item{calcNull}{logical; calculate statistics for the null model as well?
Allows for statistics such as the limited information TLI and CFI. Only valid when items all
have a suitable null model (e.g., those created via \code{\link{createItem}} will not)}

\item{na.rm}{logical; remove rows with any missing values? The M2 family of statistics
requires a complete dataset in order to be well defined}

\item{quadpts}{number of quadrature points to use during estimation. If \code{NULL},
a suitable value will be chosen based
on the rubric found in \code{\link{fscores}}}

\item{theta_lim}{lower and upper range to evaluate latent trait integral for each dimension}

\item{impute}{a number indicating how many imputations to perform
(passed to \code{\link{imputeMissing}}) when there are missing data present. This requires
a precomputed \code{Theta} input. Will return a data.frame object with the mean estimates
of the stats and their imputed standard deviations}

\item{CI}{numeric value from 0 to 1 indicating the range of the confidence interval for
RMSEA. Default returns the 90\% interval}

\item{residmat}{logical; return the residual matrix used to compute the SRMSR statistic?
Only the lower triangle of the residual correlation matrix will be returned
(the upper triangle is filled with NA's)}

\item{QMC}{logical; use quasi-Monte Carlo integration? Useful for higher dimensional models.
If \code{quadpts} not specified, 5000 nodes are used by default}

\item{suppress}{a numeric value indicating which parameter residual dependency combinations
to flag as being too high. Absolute values for the standardized residuals greater than
this value will be returned, while all values less than this value will be set to NA.
Must be used in conjunction with the argument \code{residmat = TRUE}}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame object with the M2-type statistic, along with the degrees of freedom,
  p-value, RMSEA (with 90\% confidence interval), SRMSR for each group (if all items were ordinal),
  and optionally the TLI and CFI model fit statistics if \code{calcNull = TRUE}.
}
\description{
Computes the M2 (Maydeu-Olivares & Joe, 2006) statistic when all data are dichotomous,
the collapsed M2* statistic (collapsing over univariate and bivariate response categories;
see Cai and Hansen, 2013), and the hybrid C2 statistic which only collapses only the bivariate
moments (Cai and Monro, 2014). The C2 variant is mainly useful when polytomous response models
do not have sufficient degrees of freedom to compute M2*. This function
also computes associated fit indices that are based on
fitting the null model. Supports single and multiple-group models.
If the latent trait density was approximated (e.g., Davidian curves, Empirical histograms, etc)
then passing \code{use_dentype_estimate = TRUE} will use the internally saved quadrature and
density components (where applicable).

\examples{
\dontrun{
dat <- as.matrix(expand.table(LSAT7))
(mod1 <- mirt(dat, 1))
M2(mod1)
M2(mod1, residmat=TRUE) #lower triangle of residual correlation matrix

#M2 imputed with missing data present (run in parallel)
dat[sample(1:prod(dim(dat)), 250)] <- NA
mod2 <- mirt(dat, 1)

# compute stats using conservative model imputations
mirtCluster()
M2(mod2, impute = 10)

# or compute stats by removing missing data row-wise
M2(mod2, na.rm = TRUE)

# C2 statistic (useful when polytomous IRT models have too few df)
pmod <- mirt(Science, 1)
# This fails with too few df:
# M2(pmod)
# This, however, works:
M2(pmod, type = 'C2')
