\arguments{
\item{MGmodel}{an object returned from \code{\link{multipleGroup}} to be used as the reference
model}

\item{which.par}{a character vector containing the parameter names which will be inspected for
DIF}

\item{scheme}{type of DIF analysis to perform, either by adding or dropping constraints across
  groups. These can be:
\describe{
  \item{'add'}{parameters in \code{which.par} will be constrained each item one at a time for
    items that are specified in \code{items2test}. This is beneficial when examining DIF from a
    model with parameters freely estimated across groups, and when inspecting differences via
    the Wald test}
  \item{'drop'}{parameters in \code{which.par} will be freely estimated for items that are
    specified in \code{items2test}. This is useful when supplying an overly restrictive model
    and attempting to detect DIF with a slightly less restrictive model}
  \item{'add_sequential'}{sequentially loop over the items being tested, and at the end of the
    loop treat DIF tests that satisfy the \code{seq_stat} criteria as invariant. The loop is
    then re-run on the remaining invariant items to determine if they are now displaying DIF in
    the less constrained model, and when no new invariant item is found the algorithm stops and
    returns the items that displayed DIF. Note that the DIF statistics are relative to this final,
    less constrained model which includes the DIF effects}
  \item{'drop_sequential'}{sequentially loop over the items being tested, and at the end of the
    loop treat items that violate the \code{seq_stat} criteria as demonstrating DIF. The loop is
    then re-run, leaving the items that previously demonstrated DIF as variable across groups,
    and the remaining test items that previously showed invariance are re-tested. The algorithm
    stops when no more items showing DIF are found and returns the items that displayed DIF.
    Note that the DIF statistics are relative to this final,
    less constrained model which includes the DIF effects}
}}

\item{items2test}{a numeric vector, or character vector containing the item names, indicating
which items will be tested for DIF. In models where anchor items are known, omit them from
this vector. For example, if items 1 and 2 are anchors in a 10 item test, then
\code{items2test = 3:10} would work for testing the remaining items (important to remember
when using sequential schemes)}

\item{groups2test}{a character vector indicating which groups to use in the DIF testing
investigations. Default is \code{'all'}, which uses all group information to perform
joint hypothesis tests of DIF (for a two group setup these result in pair-wise tests).
For example, if the group names were 'g1', 'g2' and 'g3', and DIF was only to be investigated
between group 'g1' and 'g3' then pass \code{groups2test = c('g1', 'g3')}}

\item{seq_stat}{select a statistic to test for in the sequential schemes. Potential values are
(in descending order of power) \code{'AIC'}, \code{'SABIC'}, \code{'HQ'}, and \code{'BIC'}.
If a numeric value is input that ranges between 0 and 1, the 'p' value will be tested
(e.g., \code{seq_stat = .05} will test for the difference of p < .05 in the add scheme,
or p > .05 in the drop scheme), along with the specified \code{p.adjust} input}

\item{Wald}{logical; perform Wald tests for DIF instead of likelihood ratio test?}

\item{p.adjust}{string to be passed to the \code{\link{p.adjust}} function to adjust p-values.
Adjustments are located in the \code{adj_p} element in the returned list. Default uses the
Holm-sequential Bonferroni adjustment}

\item{pairwise}{logical; perform pairwise tests between groups when the number of groups
is greater than 2? Useful as quickly specified post-hoc tests}

\item{return_models}{logical; return estimated model objects for further analysis?
Default is FALSE}

\item{return_seq_model}{logical; on the last iteration of the sequential schemes, return
the fitted multiple-group model containing the freely estimated parameters indicative of
DIF? This is generally only useful when \code{scheme = 'add_sequential'}. Default is FALSE}

\item{max_run}{a number indicating the maximum number of cycles to perform in sequential
searches. The default is to perform search until no further DIF is found}

\item{plotdif}{logical; create item plots for items that are displaying DIF according to the
\code{seq_stat} criteria? Only available for 'add' type schemes}

\item{type}{the \code{type} of plot argument passed to \code{plot()}. Default is 'trace', though
another good option is 'infotrace'. For ease of viewing, the \code{facet_item} argument to
mirt's \code{plot()} function is set to \code{TRUE}}

\item{simplify}{logical; simplify the output by returning a data.frame object with
the differences between AIC, BIC, etc, as well as the chi-squared test (X2) and associated
df and p-values}

\item{verbose}{logical print extra information to the console?}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link{multipleGroup}} and \code{plot}}
}
\value{
a \code{mirt_df} object with the information-based criteria for DIF, though this may be changed
  to a list output when \code{return_models} or \code{simplify} are modified. As well, a silent
  \code{'DIF_coefficeints'} attribute is included to view the item parameter differences
  between the groups
}
\description{
This function runs the Wald and likelihood-ratio approaches for testing differential
item functioning (DIF) with two or more groups. This is primarily a convenience wrapper to the
\code{\link{multipleGroup}} function for performing standard DIF procedures. Independent
models can be estimated in parallel by defining a parallel object with \code{\link{mirtCluster}},
which will help to decrease the run time. For best results, the baseline model should contain
a set of 'anchor' items and have freely estimated hyper-parameters in the focal groups.
}
\details{
Generally, the pre-computed baseline model should have been
configured with two estimation properties: 1) a set of 'anchor' items,
where the anchor items have various parameters that have been constrained to be equal
across the groups, and 2) contain freely estimated latent mean and variance terms in
all but one group (the so-called 'reference' group).
These two properties help to fix the metric of the groups so that
item parameter estimates do not contain latent distribution characteristics.
