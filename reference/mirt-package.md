# Full information maximum likelihood estimation of IRT models.

Full information maximum likelihood estimation of multidimensional IRT
models

## Details

Analysis of dichotomous and polytomous response data using
unidimensional and multidimensional latent trait models under the Item
Response Theory (IRT) paradigm. Exploratory and confirmatory models can
be estimated with quadrature (EM) or stochastic (MHRM) methods.
Confirmatory bi-factor and two-tier analyses are available for modeling
item testlets. Multiple group analysis and mixed effects designs also
are available for detecting differential item and test functioning as
well as modeling item and person covariates. Finally, latent class
models such as the DINA, DINO, multidimensional latent class, mixture
and zero-inflated IRT models, and several other discrete variable models
are supported.
